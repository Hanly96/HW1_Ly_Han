				<p class="text_myDiscription">Music</p></br>

				<p>As a little girl, I was familiar with music. I have been learning piano since I was five. </br>
				
				When I have suffered stress, music can help me to deal the problems.</br>
				
				I love the feeling that I can get lost in music. Playing piano can always be my option when I have a day off</p>

				<p>I am a fan of food. I fond of trying new food which looks tasty, delicious.</br> 

				My country has a variety of food that I would like to share with my international friends.</br>

				It is also delighted for me to take photos of those which are eaten by me.</br>
